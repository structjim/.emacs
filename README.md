# .emacs
My .emacs file, for regular old GNU Emacs.

It's mostly just here so i can download it conveniently. But if you want to try it, put it in your home folder (~) on Linux or in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming` on Windows, then launch GNU Emacs. You'll know it worked if the window background is purple and the cursor is UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC. Also, I use Comic Code, but I can't include it here because it's a paid font.
